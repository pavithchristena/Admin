                 operated by the online retailer Amazon. The stores are cashierless, thus partially automated, with customers able to purchase
                  products without being checked out by a cashier or using a self-checkout station.[2][3] As of 2020, there 
                are 29 open and announced store locations in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, London and New York City.</p></h3>
